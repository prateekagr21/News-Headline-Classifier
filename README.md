# News Headline Classification with Deep Learning !

## I have used Recurrent Neural Networks to train my model.

Firstly, Trained with  LSTM \
And then with Bidirectional LSTM. 

Predicted and showed a Classification report\
in order to compare between these two \
to know which works better in these problem statements !
